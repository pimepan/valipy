# Introduction

## Valipy

Valipy is a simple, chainable and composable data validation library that aims to be used in any place where you need to make sure data is schematized in a certain way.

Valipy is heavily inspired on the js validation library [v8n.js](https://github.com/imbrn/v8n) and it tries it best to be an almost 1:1 python alternative.

## Python Version Support

Valipy currently only supports **python >3.11**. This is beacuse Valipy uses some features from the typing module only available for the newest python releases.

## Features

- Chainable API
- Plenty of validation rules  ())
- Create your own validation rules
