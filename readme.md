# Valipy

Valipy is a simple, chainable and composable data validation library that aims to be used in any place where you need to make sure data is schematized in a certain way.

Valipy is heavily inspired on the js validation library [v8n.js](https://github.com/imbrn/v8n) and it tries it best to be an almost 1:1 python alternative.

## Python Version Support

Valipy currently only supports **python >3.11**. This is beacuse Valipy uses some features from the typing module only available for the newest python releases.

## Features

1. Chainable API
2. Plenty of validation rules  (20+)
3. Create your own validation rules
4. Reusable
5. Can use Regex
6. granular exceptions
7. Schema Validation

## Instalation

As easy as

`pip install valipy`
